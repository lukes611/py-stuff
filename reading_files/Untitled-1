data repsentation: tuples vs dicts vs lists
    lessons:
        illustrate:
            tuple: points, pairs
            dict: named, pairs, quick access
            list: quick iteration
    questionaire:
        use what for what?
    programming practice:
        using tuple to record points, summed distance
        dict to specify options (drawing something)
        convert list of points to list of dict points
        data analytics
        faster computation

    lessons:
        illustrate:
            class
            linked list
            linked list operations:
                construct by hand
                loop through
                push to front
                push to back
    programming practice:
        make your own
